## Setting Up and Running a Flask App

Follow these steps to set up and run a Flask app:

1. **Install Flask**:

 Use the following command to install Flask:

   pip install Flask
 ```
## Activate your virtual environment:
Replace "venv" with your virtual environment name and adjust the command for your operating system if needed.

** For Windows: **
 ``` bash
venv\Scripts\activate
 ```
** For macOS and Linux: **
 ``` bash
source venv/bin/activate
 ```
## Run your Flask app:

 python app.py runserver 
 ```
This will start the development server, and you can access your Flask app in a web browser at the provided URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
